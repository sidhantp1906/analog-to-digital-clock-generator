# analog-to-digital-clock-generator
Here i designed a converter circuit which converts analog sine signal to digital clock signal.This is my personal work which suddenly came into my mind so i designed.I used half wave rectifier circuit with filter to get +ve half of sine wave and then used comparator to convert that into square wave which is digital clock output.
